# Contributing to Tools for Builders

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We want to make this the best collection of tools for tech professionals, and your help is vital.

## 📋 Guidelines

To keep the list high-quality and easy to read, please follow these rules when adding a new tool:

1.  **Relevance:** The tool must be relevant to technology professionals (Developers, DevOps, Designers, PMs, etc.).
2.  **Uniqueness:** Ensure the tool isn't already listed.
3.  **Description:** Keep descriptions short, concise, and objective.
4.  **Formatting:** Use the following format for list items:

    ```markdown
    - [Tool Name](URL) - Short description ending with a period. (Tags)
    ```

    *Example:*
    `- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - A powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. (Free | 💸 Paid Sync)`
